🌟 Day 23: Array Problems in C++ with Love Babbar 🚀

Hey everyone! 👋

I’m excited to share my progress on solving various array problems using C++, guided by Love Babbar. Today’s focus was on practical implementations and techniques to handle different array-related challenges.

📚 What I Worked On:

1. Printing Pairs Using Nested Loops
    - Problem Statement: Print all pairs of elements in an array.
    - Approach: Utilized nested loops to iterate through the array and print each pair.

2. Finding Triplets
    - **Problem Statement:** Print all triplets of elements in an array.
    - Approach: Implemented three nested loops to iterate through the array and print each triplet.

3. Shifting Elements
    - Problem Statement: Shift array elements to the right, left, or by a specific index.
    - Approach: Developed functions to shift elements to the right, left, and by a specified index.

4. Sorting 0s and 1s
    - Problem Statement: Sort an array containing only 0s and 1s, ensuring all 0s come first.
    - Approach: Applied a two-pointer technique to efficiently sort the array.

5. Finding Unique Element
    - Problem Statement: Identify the unique element in an array where every other element appears twice.
    - Approach: Utilized the bitwise XOR operation to find the unique element among duplicates.

💡 Why This Matters:
Mastering these array operations is crucial for understanding more advanced algorithms and data structures. These problems not only strengthen your coding skills but also prepare you for technical interviews.
